# Hi, I'm Manpasu! 👋
I'm an enthusiastic cloud infrastructure engineer. For more than 2 years I have been designing and integrating distributed, scalable cloud systems. I leverage my expertise in modular and microservice architectures to ensure system reliability, resilience, maintainability, and ease of upgrades. Most importantly, to minimize the radius of impact when part of a system fails.  My passion lies in delving into the world of cloud computing technology, exploring innovative solutions, and sharing my knowledge through open-source contributions or blog posts on best practices. I have worked mostly on private [on-prem] cloud infrastructure - for public cloud, I have used AWS in 3 projects, but I am more experienced with GCP.

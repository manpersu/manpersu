# Hi, I'm Manpasu! 👋

I am a curious cloud infrastructure engineer! My curiousity goes from system design to system reliability to system automation.
I have been designing systems for more than 3 years. I find systems designed based on modular or microservice architecture to be intriguing. It makes it possible to easily upgrade or even replace a 
module or a microservice witout impacting the whole system. Ensuring system reliability, robustness and resilience is much easier with this kind of architecture. 😄 You're right, it is more expensive compared to
other architectures. 
I want the work I do to say something about who I am, how I feel and how I think.
I enjoy working with Cloud Infrastructures - private, hybrid and public cloud infrastructure.  My journey involves delving into the world of computer science, exploring new ideas, and sharing my insights with the community.
